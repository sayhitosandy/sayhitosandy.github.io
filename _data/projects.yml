  image: /resources/img/adl.jpg
  description: "Performed a detailed analysis to understand the limitations of 
  the existing RAG systems, and identified and provided concrete examples of 
  failure cases, along with future avenues of improvement. Examples included 
  managing unrelated noise from external sources, handling mathematical 
  reasoning, effectively integrating information, interpreting negative or 
  missing statements, dealing with conflicting knowledge, and the difficulty in 
  evaluations."

- title: "Transformer-based Language Modeling and Classification"
  description: "Implemented a custom transformer encoder and feedforward 
  classifier from scratch, achieving 86.2% accuracy in political speech text 
  classification. Pretrained a GPT-like transformer decoder, achieving a 
  language model perplexity of 149.8 (out of a vocabulary of 5755) on political 
  speeches. Enhanced model performance by further reducing perplexity by 38.2% 
  using ALiBi for positional encoding and by 52% using Xavier/Normal 
  initialization techniques."

- title: "An Overview of the Mamba State Space Model"
  description: "Investigated limitations of subquadratic-time architectures in 
  handling long sequences, focusing on the lack of content-based reasoning. 
  Performed a case study on Mamba, a novel neural network architecture 
  integrating selective structured state space models (SSMs) to address this 
  limitation. Mamba demonstrates improved performance on language processing 
  tasks compared to existing subquadratic-time architectures."
