  research_statement: >-
    I'm particularly interested in <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> and <em>Data Science</em>. I enjoy learning and
    working on projects related to <em>Machine Learning</em>, <em>Natural Language Processing</em>, <em>Information
    Retrieval</em> and <em>Recommender Systems</em>. I firmly believe that research outcomes should be equitable to all
    sections of society, and intend to contribute to the same using novel artificial intelligence-based solutions.
