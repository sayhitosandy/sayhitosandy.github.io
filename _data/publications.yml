  abstract: "> <div style='text-align: justify'> We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create 
  and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant 
  items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are 
  relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the 
  user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering 
  techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas 
  in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 
  2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in 
  effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items. To our knowledge, 
  these are first of its kind experiments at such a large scale.</div>"

  abstract: "> <div style='text-align: justify'> Virtual Reality Walkthroughs provide an immersive experience of a real 
  place. Through this project, we automate the creation of VR walkthroughs for large spaces, with the case study of 
  IIIT-Delhi's campus. Our project involves campus terrain 3D mapping and reconstruction, along with optimal drone path 
  planning to cover campus terrain, autonomously. The goal is to minimize the manual intervention throughout the 
  pipeline, along with proposing several improvements in coverage path planning and polygon decomposition.</div>"
